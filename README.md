<h2>Initial discussion</h2>

In the initial planning meeting with the bar manager of Escape Pool Bar, he requested a website that would easily provide information to customers.
The staff were spending a lot of time at the bar explaining the details of how their pool bar works to customers, which was wasting time that the staff could be doing other duties.

Their target demnographic is mainly male with an age range of 16 - 65 years old. 

The main information that customers ask for are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pricing (table rates, guest fees)</li>
<li>How their table pricing works</li>
<li>Membership information</li>
<li>Deals and discounts</li>
<li>Parking</li>
<li>Opening hours</li>
<li>History of the building</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>How to book a table</li>
</ul>
