This is the website for Escape Pool Bar, designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to access any information that their customers could need.

<h2>Planning</h2>

<h3>Initial discussion</h3>

In the initial planning meeting with the bar manager of Escape Pool Bar, he requested a website that would easily provide information to customers.
The staff were spending a lot of time at the bar explaining the details of how their pool bar works to customers, which was wasting time that the staff could be doing other duties.

Their target demnographic is mainly male with an age range of 16 - 65 years old. 

The main information that customers ask for are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pricing (table rates, guest fees)</li>
<li>How their table pricing works</li>
<li>Membership information</li>
<li>Deals and discounts</li>
<li>Parking</li>
<li>Opening hours</li>
<li>History of the building</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>How to book a table</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scope</h3>

We discussed the features that they wanted included in their website. They requested text information, a gallery of images, a PDF download for the membership form, and an embedded Google maps box.

Those features fit well with the time and ability I have, and we agreed that a few bits of information were not necessary, including the history of the building, the drinks deals, and most of the student discounts.
These were then removed from our planning before I designed the wireframes.
