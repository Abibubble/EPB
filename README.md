<h2>Initial discussion</h2>

In the initial planning meeting with the bar manager of Escape Pool Bar, he requested a website that would easily provide information to customers.
The staff were spending a lot of time at the bar explaining the details of how their pool bar works to customers, which was wasting time that the staff could be doing other duties.

Their target demnographic is mainly male with an age range of 16 - 65 years old. 

The main information that customers ask for are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pricing (table rates, guest fees)</li>
<li>How their table pricing works</li>
<li>Membership information</li>
<li>Deals and discounts</li>
<li>Parking</li>
<li>Opening hours</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>How to book a table</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section</h3> <--UPDATE THIS-->
<h4>First Time Visitor Goals</h4>
<em>I want to easily learn more about the bar.</em>
Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a navigation bar that is clean and easy to read to take them to the information that they need.
Underneath this, there is a hero image of a game of pool, making it obvious at first glance what the website is for.
The user then has two options - click in the navbar to navigate to another page, or scroll down.
Scrolling down leads to more information about the bar.

<em>I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information.</em>
At the top of each page there is a clean and easy to read navigation bar, with each link describing what the page they will end up at clearly.
The logo in the top left of each page also links to the homepage, following standard convention.

<em>I want to locate their social media links to see their social media prescence.</em>
In the footer of each page, there is a link to their Facebook site.
In the Contact Us page, there is a link to their Twitter page, and two links to their Facebook site (one to the Facebook in general, and one to prompt to book a table).
Any links that they click to an external site will open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

<h4>Returning Visitor Goals</h4>
<em>I want to find current information about Covid-19.</em>
On the homepage, there is a bright yellow scrolling banner that is eye-catching and bold, directly under the navbar that explains the current situation with Covid-19.

<em>I want to find the best way to get in contact with the bar with any questions I may have.</em>
The navigation bar has a clear link called 'Contact Us', where all the contact details are visible.
The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate contact details and a Facebook link in the footer.

<h4>Frequent User Goals</h4>
<em>I want to submit a booking request</em>
Scrolling down on the Contact Us page gives a form on tablet and desktop that cal be filled in to submit a table booking request.
There is also an alternative link to their Facebook page, where a table booking can also be submitted.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Amazon Fire tablet, OPPO Find X2 Lite, Samsung Galaxy A70, Samsung Galazy S9, and Samsung A20.
A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
