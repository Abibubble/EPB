## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
In the initial planning meeting with the bar manager of Escape Pool Bar, he requested a website that would easily provide information to customers.
The staff were spending a lot of time at the bar explaining the details of how their pool bar works to customers, which was wasting time that the staff could be doing other duties.

Their target demographic is mainly male with an age range of 16 - 65 years old. 

The main information that customers ask for are as follows:
* Pricing (table rates, guest fees)
* How their table pricing works
* Membership information
* Deals and discounts
* Parking
* Opening hours
* Contact information
* How to book a table

### User Stories
#### Client Goals
* We want to have the information that customers often ask for displayed in an easy to find way.
* We want to make it easier for our customers to understand how our pricing works
* We want to make it easy for customers to find us

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* I want to easily learn more about the bar.
* I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information.
* I want to locate their social media links to see their social media prescence.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* I want to find current information about Covid-19.
* I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

#### Frequent User Goals
* I want to submit a booking request.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The main colours used are white and green, to correlate with English Pool colours (green cloth, white cue ball). 
The other colours used are black, white and gray, with those being the colours used in the Escape Pool Bar logo and branding.

### Typography
The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the Poppins font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Imagery
The large background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, making it clear at first glance what the company does. 
It has a modern aesthetic, and directly correlates to the company.

### Wireframes
I created wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet, and a user navigation map for the movements a user can make.
[Here is a link to the Wireframes and User Navigation Map](assets/epb-wireframes.pdf)

### Features
* Text information
* Images
* PDF download
* Embedded Google Maps box
* Images carousel
* Responsive on all device sizes

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
The only errors found were due to Bootstrap code and the Google Maps embed code.

### Testing User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### I want to easily learn more about the bar.
Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a navigation bar that is clean and easy to read to take them to the information that they need. 
Underneath this, there is a hero image of a game of pool, making it obvious at first glance what the website is for. 
The user then has two options - click in the navbar to navigate to another page, or scroll down. 
Scrolling down leads to more information about the bar.

##### I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information.
At the top of each page there is a clean and easy to read navigation bar, with each link describing what the page they will end up at clearly. 
The logo in the top left of each page also links to the homepage, following standard convention.

##### I want to locate their social media links to see their social media prescence.
In the footer of each page, there is a link to their Facebook site. 
In the Contact Us page, there is a link to their Twitter page, and two links to their Facebook site (one to the Facebook in general, and one to prompt to book a table). 
Any links that they click to an external site will open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### I want to find current information about Covid-19.
On the homepage, there is a bright yellow scrolling banner that is eye-catching and bold, directly under the navbar that explains the current situation with Covid-19.

##### I want to find the best way to get in contact with the bar with any questions I may have.
The navigation bar has a clear link called 'Contact Us', where all the contact details are visible. 
The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate contact details and a Facebook link in the footer.

#### Frequent User Goals
##### I want to submit a booking request
Scrolling down on the Contact Us page gives a form on tablet and desktop that cal be filled in to submit a table booking request. 
There is also an alternative link to their Facebook page, where a table booking can also be submitted.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
* Custom built desktop PC, running Windows 10
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* iPad 6,11 5th generation, running iOS 10.3
* Amazon Fire tablet 7
* iPhone 7
* iPhone X
* iPhone 12
* OPPO Find X2 Lite
* Samsung Galaxy A70
* Samsung Galaxy S9
* Samsung Galaxy S10+
* Samsung A20

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the form .
Friends, family members, members of staff and 13 customers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Solved Bugs
1. The links stopped working when I deployed this project to GitHub Pages.
    * Whilst building the project, none of the links worked without a / in front of the page link.
    * When it came to deploying the project, the links didn't work because of this.
    * Thanks to @JimLynx_lead on Slack, he pointed out that links should not have a / before the page link.
    * I removed these across the project, and the links worked.

2. The footer had a 10px gap underneath it on every page.
    * I checked Google DevTools to see where this gap could have come from. I didn't see anything that looked like it would cause the gap.
    * I then checked the Bootstrap code for all the code affecting my elements, again finding nothing.
    * By this point, I'd been looking at the code so long, it all seemed correct.
    * I reached out on Slack, and heard back from Daisy Mc Gurr, who checked DevTools and saw a line I'd missed.
    * My p tag on the left side had a 1rem margin-bottom, set by Bootstrap.
    * I then set margin-bottom to 0 for all p elements to fix the bug.

3. To create the scrolling alert bar on the Homepage, I'd used the marquee element, which I discovered is an obselete tag.
    * I removed the marquee element, so I wouldn't forget it needed to go.
    * I thought through what I'd need, and realised I'd need some form of animation.
    * As I haven't used animation styles very much, I decided to follow a tutorial I found on Google to create it.
    * Special thanks to [Ryan d'Souza](https://dev.to/ryandsouza13/creating-the-classic-marquee-effect-without-the-marquee-tag-4246) for this code.
    * I then entered this code, with my own tweaks for the styling that I required, which worked well, and also gives me more control over the scrolling alert bar.

4. Responsive design was a challenge on landscape devices, often with pages either disappearing behind the navigation bar, or appearing way too far below the naavigation bar.
    * Checked Responsinator and noted down each orientation and screen width that there were issues, and what issues they were.
    * Updated media queries.
    * Hid some unimportant elements (such as line breaks and horizonal lines).
    * Added margin-top to certain pages on certain screen widths and orientations to correct the issue.
    * There was more of a bug with the landscape iPhone 6-8 specifically (but no other screen sizes), so I edited the media queries to suit this size specifically.

5. The navigation bar didn't fill the viewport width, with all the navigation items being pushed to the left.
    * I'd created the navigation bar using Bootstrap's row and col grid system of classes.
    * I tried using just col classes, which didn't automatically fill the viewport width.
    * I then used col-2 classes on each of the 5 navigation items, and the logo, which also didn't work.
    * I searched Google and looked at DevTools, but couldn't see anything there.
    * I reached out on Slack, and @Seanyoung247 commented that my navigation bar row wasn't filling the full viewport width, it was left aligned in the container, which is the default.
    * I added 'width: 100%;' to my navigation bar, which solved the problem.

6. When I set my navigation bar to collapse into a burger bar dropdown menu, it only did so on small mobile devices, not for larger mobile devices and tablet like I wanted.
    * I tried changing my navbar-expand class to sm or md, but it still didn't work on tablets, although this did fix the issue on all mobile sizes.
    * I looked at DevTools, but I couldn't see anything, and I suspected that I was missing some code, rather than having written something wrong.
    * I searched on Google, and couldn't find any helpful fixes
    * I reached out to the Slack community, and Harry Dhillon suggested using a larger navbar-expand class.
    * I tested a few different sizes, and settled on xl, which covered all sizes of tablet and mobile, but didn't include desktop or laptop sizes.

7. On mobile devices, you could scroll to the right and get a white bar down the side of the screen.
    * I suspected it was due to a Bootstrap class adding padding that I wasn't expecting.
    * On DevTools, I searched each Bootstrap class, and found that each col class had 15px padding-left and padding-right.
    * I set a style rule to remove this, which fixed the issue.
    * Finally, I checked to ensure that this hadn't caused any styling issues elsewhere, which it hadn't.

### Known Bugs
* On mobile, the nav bar moves slightly behind the URL area upon scrolling down.
* On mobile, the page loads slightly zoomed in on Homepage, Membership, and How It Works.
* On Samsung Galaxy A70, the screen respolution is the same as a laptop, so the responsivity doesn't work as well.


### Lighthouse
I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and originally got this result.

![Lighthouse first try](https://i.imgur.com/ELJvrmg.png)

I resized all the images I used in the website, as Lighthouse suggested that they were too big and reducing my performance, and 
I got this result on both my Home page and my Gallery page (which is the most image-heavy page). I added rel="noopener" to all of my external links, to improve the Best Practices score.

![Lighthouse Homepage](https://i.imgur.com/GrKowWR.png)

#### Performance:
I have lowered the size of my image files to boost this score, but not to a point that reduced their quality. 
The remaining suggestions for performance were:
* Reduce the size of the image for my hero image, but I was not willing to lower the quality of this element.
* Save images in next-gen formats, such as JPEG 2000, which I decided against for simplicity.
* Eliminate render-blocking resources, which came up as Bootstrap so I was unable to improve this.

Despite these 3 points of improvement, I am happy to accept a score of 98.

#### Accessibility:
I have ALT text on all images and features throughout the site, and text for screen readers where necessary, giving me a score of 100.

#### Best Practices:
I checked all my code on [W3C Validator](#w3c-validator) before looking at this. There were 3 suggestions for improvement.
* The logo was called up for being an incorrect size, however, it resizes depending on the device being used, so I couldn't improve this.
* The logo was also called up for being of a low quality, because the aspect ratios were slightly off due to responsive design. However, as it's a simple logo, this doesn't reduce the quality on the website.
* The link with jQuery has 'JavaScript libraries with known vulnerabilities', with 3 vulnerabilities, which reduced my score in this area.
 
I will continue to look into this as I learn more, with an aim to improving this score beyond 79.

#### SEO:
Unfortunately I'm not very well-versed in SEO practices, although the site seemed to do well regardless. To improve this from 92 to 100, I added a meta description.
